# Programming for Data Analysis Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter notebbook which looks at the numpy.random package, with a dicussion of many of the packages features and code examples of the package in use.

The notebook wa written with the following instructions in mind.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

The rendered notebook can be found here: https://github.com/andrewjscott/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/Numpy-random.ipynb

**NB: As of 22 November 2021 some of the tags for the Table of Contents and Referencing are not rendered properly on github. All the content is still accurate, but tags are visible and
what were intended to be links do not work. The tags are rendered properly when the repository is cloned and the notebook opened in jupyter lab, however, so this is the recommended method for viewing the notebook.**

### To rerun the analysis on your own machine
1. Install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
  - Alternatively, if you already have Python installed, you can download the requirements.txt file and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Install Cmder - https://cmder.net/
3. Download this repository with the following command using Cmder - git clone https://github.com/andrewjscott/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment
4. Enter the following command using Cmder - jupyter lab
5. In the Jupyter tab that opens in your browser, navigate to the Numpy-random.ipynb file and open 
6. Click on Run and then click on Restart Kernal and Run all cells.
  - Note: One cell will return an error on purpose, which may prevent subsequent calls from running. If this happens then select the cell below the error, click run, and 
    select Run Selected Cell and All Below
